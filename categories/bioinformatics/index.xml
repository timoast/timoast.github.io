      <description>Installing magic Recently a method for imputing single cell gene expression matricies was posted on biorxiv by David van Dijk et al., called magic (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells). I&amp;rsquo;ve been analysing single cell RNA-seq data recently, and this method looks like it could be useful when trying to find co-transcriptional networks, as single cell data suffers from dropout which makes finding co-transcriptional networks hard.
I had lots of problems getting magic installed and running, so will document them here for future reference.</description>

      <description>Whole genome bisulfite sequencing analysis notes for BS-seeker2.  Step 1: Trim adapters and low quality bases Illumina TruSeq adapter sequence: GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC -m 50 reads.fastq \ | seqtk trimfq -l 50 - \ | pigz &amp;gt; filtered_reads.fq.gz  Step 2: Quality control This step can also be performed on the unfiltered fastq file to compare output before and after read trimming.
fastqc filtered_reads.fq.gz  Step 3: Alignment 3.</description>
