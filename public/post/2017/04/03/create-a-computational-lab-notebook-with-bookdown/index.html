<p>Every data analysis I do now is kept in an <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> document. These are great for mixing code with explanatory text, and you can run code in many languages not just R. Whenever I finished working on something, I would compile the R Markdown document into a self-contained html report and save is somewhere, usually with a descriptive filename like &ldquo;coverage_genes&rdquo; or &ldquo;col_vs_cvi&rdquo;.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>This is where the problems begin. These reports, while great individually, can quickly pile up and you start to realize that the name &ldquo;coverage_genes&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really help you find a bit of code you wrote 3 weeks ago. What you really want is everything in one place. I would routinely open up 5-10 html files and hit CMD+f on each one to try to find something I knew I wrote a few weeks ago. There had to be a better way.</p>

<h3 id="bookdown">Bookdown</h3>

<p><a href="http://bookdown.org">Bookdown</a> is an R package that collects a group of separate R Markdown documents and merges them into a single document &ndash; a book. There are some great examples of books written using bookdown (<a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for data science</a> by Hadley Wickham is one). A couple of weeks ago I started using bookdown to create a computational lab notebook to store all my data analysis documents in one place, and since bookdown just collects different R Markdown documents, I didn&rsquo;t really need to change anything I was doing. So far it&rsquo;s been working really well.</p>

<p>However, bookdown was created with slightly different goals in mind to what I want. Normally, you would need to re-run all the R code each time you build the book in order to get all the entries to display correctly. For me this was a problem &ndash; by the of the year I&rsquo;d be re-running every analysis I&rsquo;d done that year every time I wanted to add something new.</p>

<p>Instead, I wrote a shell script that cheats a little bit by copying the intermediate markdown files generated by bookdown to a new folder and building the book from that instead. That way, each new analysis can be run once to generate a markdown file, then that markdown file copied over to a separate book and the book re-built. Re-building the book in this case is very fast because it&rsquo;s not running any analysis code.</p>

<h3 id="getting-interactive-plots-and-tables">Getting interactive plots and tables</h3>

<p>Now, the problem with this approach is if some outputs in your R Markdown documents need special javascript libraries to be included in order to run (eg plotly, pagedtable, htmlwidgets), that information is lost. This can be fixed by adding an extra <code>html</code> file to the book&rsquo;s directory that sources the libraries, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href=&quot;libs/pagedtable-1.1/css/pagedtable.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;libs/pagedtable-1.1/js/pagedtable.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;libs/htmlwidgets-0.8/htmlwidgets.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;libs/plotlyjs-1.16.3/plotly-htmlwidgets.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;libs/plotlyjs-1.16.3/plotly-latest.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;libs/plotly-binding-4.5.6/pl
</code></pre>

<p>I saved this in a file called <code>libs.html</code>. Then, in the <code>_output.yml</code> file (used for bookdown configuration), add:</p>

<pre><code>  includes:
    in_header: libs.html
</code></pre>

<p>Now, that&rsquo;s basically everything you need to get a computational lab notebook working using bookdown. My notebook looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/notebook.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 80%;"/></p>

<h3 id="hosting-the-book">Hosting the book</h3>

<p>One drawback however is that using this type of notebook can make it hard to share results with people. Previously, when I would use a single self-contained <code>html</code> document to store everything, it was really easy to send that to whoever needed to see it. Now, using a book, there are many interconnected files and I can&rsquo;t easily send someone a document to read through. One solution would be to host the book on github pages, but then anyone would be able to read what we&rsquo;ve been working on, which isn&rsquo;t always ideal.</p>

<p>I decided to host my notebook using amazon web services S3. It was pretty easy to put the files into a bucket and have it render a static site. The advantage of this is that while the site is viewable by anyone, the address is very cryptic and no-one would come across it by accident or by viewing my github page.</p>

<p>To make the aws s3 bucket, I just went through the “host a static website” guide on amazon and it took ~5 mins. However, I had to drag-and-drop files from my computer to the site, which is annoying if I were to do that each time I update the site.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">AWS command line tools</a> has a sync function that will let you upload files to an S3 bucket. All I had to do then is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">aws s3 sync notebook_render/_book s3://[bucket name]
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you only upload the <code>_book</code> directory.</p>

<p>I added this to my shell script with a command line option, so that each time I build the book I can also choose if I want to upload it to amazon.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-own-lab-notebook">Creating your own lab notebook</h3>

<p>You can start a lab book by cloning or forking the template I made at <a href="https://github.com/timoast/notebook-template">https://github.com/timoast/notebook-template</a>.</p>

<p>This has all the files and directory structure needed, so you can then just start adding your own R Markdown files. Running the <code>build_book.sh</code> script should update your book with your latest document. <code>build_book.sh -a</code> will update the book and upload it to amazon, as long as you edit the script to put the name of your S3 bucket.</p>

<p>I also have a template that I use for each document in the book. It just makes a space for the date and a title, and puts in a code chunk running <code>devtools::session_info()</code> at the end. If you also want to use that template, install my R package from github:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">devtools::install_github(&quot;timoast/stuart&quot;)
</code></pre>
