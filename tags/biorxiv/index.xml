      <description>After posting a my first preprint to bioRxiv a few weeks ago, I have been periodically checking the number of views and PDF downloads. I became interested to see how many downloads or views the preprints on bioRxiv typically get, but this type of information isn’t actually available. What are the all-time top bioRxiv preprints? How many people are reading bioRxiv preprints on average? No-one knows! Altmetric must track this data, as it will tell you how a particular preprint ranks in relation to others, but that data hasn’t been made publicly available (as far as I can tell).</description>
