      <description>Installing magic Recently a method for imputing single cell gene expression matricies was posted on biorxiv by David van Dijk et al., called magic (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells). I&amp;rsquo;ve been analysing single cell RNA-seq data recently, and this method looks like it could be useful when trying to find co-transcriptional networks, as single cell data suffers from dropout which makes finding co-transcriptional networks hard.
I had lots of problems getting magic installed and running, so will document them here for future reference.</description>
